        Sir Frederick Grant Banting was born on November 14, 1891, in Alliston, Ontario,
        into a farming family. He developed an early interest in medicine and went on to
        earn his medical degree from the University of Toronto in 1916. During World War I,
        he served as a military doctor and was wounded in action, earning the Military Cross
        for his bravery.
        After the war, Banting initially worked in a small medical practice in London, Ontario,
        but his passion for research led him to an academic career. In 1920, while working as
        an instructor at the University of Western Ontario, he conceived the idea that led to
        the discovery of insulin. Despite initial setbacks, he persevered, collaborating with
        Charles Best, under John Macleod’s supervision, and with the biochemical expertise of
        James Collip. In 1921, they successfully isolated insulin, revolutionizing the
        treatment of diabetes.
        For this groundbreaking work, Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize in Physiology
        or Medicine in 1923, making Banting the youngest Nobel laureate in this category. Banting
        chose not to patent insulin, believing it should be accessible to all. He sold the patent
        to the University of Toronto for one dollar. Banting continued his research in other medical
        fields and was also an accomplished painter. Tragically, his life was cut short in an aviation
        accident in 1941 while serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. His legacy
        lives on through his contributions to medical science and his humanitarian values.

    <p>Sir Frederick Grant Banting is best known for his medical achievements, particularly the discovery of
      insulin.
      However, he also had a profound passion for art, particularly painting. Banting found solace in art, which
      served as a creative outlet alongside his scientific work. His artistic endeavors were influenced by his
      friendship with A.Y. Jackson, a founding member of the Group of Seven, a renowned group of Canadian
      landscape
      painters. This friendship greatly shaped Banting's approach to painting.
      Banting's artwork primarily features landscapes, often depicting the Canadian wilderness with a keen eye for
      detail and a deep appreciation for nature's beauty. His paintings reflect a unique blend of scientific
      precision
      and artistic expression, capturing the rugged yet serene Canadian landscapes.</p>
